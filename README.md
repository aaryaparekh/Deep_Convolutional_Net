# Deep_Convolutional_Net
This is a generalized deep convolutional network that classifies speech subvocalizations.

This model was built for the NeurotechX Santa Cruz club for the 2020 NeurotechX open competition in which we came 1st in the U.S.

The model is based on the following EEGNet paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310953136_EEGNet_A_Compact_Convolutional_Network_for_EEG-based_Brain-Computer_Interfaces
