# Deep_Convolutional_Net
This is a generalized deep convolutional network that classifies speech subvocalizations.

This model was built for the NeurotechX Santa Cruz club for the 2021 NeurotechX open competition in which we came 5th in the world.

The model is based on the EEGNet paper published by MIT.
